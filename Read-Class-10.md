# In memory storage

1) What is a ‘call’?  
**It's a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).**

2) How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?  
**It will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a stack overflow.**

3) What does LIFO mean?  
**Last in, first out**

4) Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.  


5) What causes a Stack Overflow?  
**It will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a stack overflow.**

1) What is a ‘refrence error’?  
**when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.**

2) What is a ‘syntax error’?  
**when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.**

3) What is a ‘range error’?  
**Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length.**

4) What is a ‘tyep error’?  
**when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.**

5) What is a breakpoint?  
**Is an intentional stopping or pausing place.**

6) What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?  
**Debuggers allow users to halt the execution of the program, examine the values of variables, step execution of the program line by line, and set breakpoints on lines or specific functions that, when hit, will halt execution of the program at that spot.**

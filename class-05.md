**Images**

The `<img>` element is used to add images to a
web page.

Image source and alt text attribute for file description
image content.
You should save the images in the size you will use
them on the webpage and appropriately.
It is better to save images in JPEG format; illustrations or
It's best to save logos that use static colors as GIF files.

**Color**

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

+ Hex codes.
+ Color names.

It is important to ensure that there is sufficient contrast
Between any text and background color otherwise
People will not be able to read your content.

**Text**

There are features to control the choice of font and size
Weight, style and spacing.
There is a limited set of fonts you can assume
Most people will install it.
You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters and words. Text can also be aligned
To the left, right, center or justification. It could be
indented.
If you want to use a wide variety of fonts, there is
Several options, but you must have the correct license
to be used.
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of a file
When the user is hovering over or clicking on the text, or
When they visit a link.

**JPEG vs PNG vs GIF**

Use the JPEG format for all photos that contain a landscape or photograph where the contrast in color and intensity is smooth. Use the PNG format for any image that needs transparency, or for images that contain text and objects with sharp contrast edges, such as logos. Use the GIF format for images that contain animation.

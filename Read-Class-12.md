# SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL            | NoSQL        |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| 1. Relational | Non-Relational    |
| 2. Verticaly Scable | horizontally scalable |
| 3. table-based | document |
| 4. better for multi-row transactions | better for unstructured |
| 5. use structured query language | dynamic schemas for unstructured data. |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- complex queries

## Give a real world example?

1. MySql
2. Oracle
3. Sqlite

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Give an real world example?

1. MongoDB
2. BigTable
3. Redis

## What is a relational database ?

- type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What is a NoSQL database ?

- NoSQL databases are primarily referred to as Non-relational or Distributed Database.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

- In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable.

## What does SQL stand for ?

- Structured Query Language

## What is a ‘schema’ ?

- A database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?

- MongoDB is more flexible.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).

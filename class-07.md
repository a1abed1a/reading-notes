# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

A **domain model** is an abstract system that describes selected aspects of a domain of knowledge, influence, or activity. The model can then be used to solve problems related to this area. A domain model is a representation of realistic, meaningful concepts related to the domain that needs to be modeled in the software. Concepts include the data involved in the business and the rules the business uses in relation to that data. The domain model takes advantage of the natural language of the domain.

The domain model generally uses domain vocabulary, allowing the representation of the model to be communicated to non-technical stakeholders. It should not refer to any technical applications such as databases or software components for which it is designed.

**The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.**

Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.
+ By default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.
+ By default, the text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned.

The `<td>` elements are the data containers of the table.
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.

Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them
for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only
remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

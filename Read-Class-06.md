3) How does pair programming work?  
**There is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the programmer who writes and is the only one who puts his hand on the keyboard. By dealing with the "mechanisms" of encryption, the driver manages the text editor, file exchange, version control, and of course writing. Navigator uses their words to guide the driver but does not provide any direct computer input. Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, and how the algorithm can be turned into code, while looking for misspellings or errors. Navigator may also use its computer as a second screen to search for solutions and documentation, but no code should be written.**

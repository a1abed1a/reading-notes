### At first you need a Wireframe and Design
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.  

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.  

#### How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

#### How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles
1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity is key

### what is HTML?
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
#### The main parts of HTML:
* **The opening tag:** This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
* **The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
* **The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
* **The element:** The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
#### An attribute should always have the following:
* A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

### Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
#### Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
```
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
```
Copy to Clipboard
By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an <h1> with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).
Semantic elements
#### These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:
```
<article>
```
```
<aside>
```
```
<details>
```
```
<figcaption>
```
```
<figure>
```
```
<footer>
```
```
<header>
```
```
<main>
```
```
<mark>
```
```
<nav>
```
```
<section>

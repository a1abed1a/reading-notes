## What I learn from [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  
First of all the definition of **MarkDown**, it's a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; 
formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

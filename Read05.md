# JavaScript Loops and iteration
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. it can execute a block of code a number of times.

### JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
+ for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
+ for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
+ for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
+ while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
+ do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

### Here are examples of For and While loops:
* For Loop.
```
var i = 5;
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
}
```
* While Loops.
```
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```

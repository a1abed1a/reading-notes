# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

Links are created using the `<a>`
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.

`<a href="http://www...">Empire</a>`

If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
`<a>` tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

**Email Links**

To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the `<a>`
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

`<a href="mailto:Email@Email.com">Email</a>`

**Linking to a Sp ecific Part of the Sa me Page**

link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element).

`<h1 id="top">Hi</h1>`

`<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>`

## Layout

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

`<div>` elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Functions and Objects

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

JavaScript functions are defined with the `function` keyword.
You can use a function declaration or a function expression.

## pair program

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Steps to keep in mind for more pleasant and effective pair programming sessions.
+ Prepare.
+ Work closely together.
+ Learn and facilitate learning.
+ Establish a rhythm.
+ Communicate effectively.
+ Embrace challenges.
